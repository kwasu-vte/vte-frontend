# Changelog

## 2025-09-18
- Auth: Standardized cookie-based auth to align with api.json
  - Proxy sets/refreshes `session_token` on login/refresh and clears it on logout
  - Removed `refresh_token` requirement in app; API only provides access token
  - `signInAction` now fetches `/v1/users/auth/me` after login and redirects by role
  - Middleware validates session via `/api/v1/users/auth/me` and enforces RBAC for `/admin`, `/mentor`, `/student`
  - `auth.ts` simplified to rely on `session_token` and refresh endpoint

- Fix: SSR auth cookie forwarding
  - Use relative `/api/...` URLs on server to ensure Next forwards cookies
  - Avoid building absolute origins in `ApiClient` to prevent missing `session_token`
  - Result: `/api/v1/users/auth/me` now receives Authorization from cookie during SSR
