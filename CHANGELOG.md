# Changelog

## 2025-09-18
- Auth: Standardized cookie-based auth to align with api.json
  - Proxy sets/refreshes `session_token` on login/refresh and clears it on logout

- Auth:  falls back to POST when GET returns 405.
## 2025-09-28 20:42:42 - Fix Authentication Race Condition

### Fixed
- **Authentication Flow Race Condition**: Fixed race condition where sign-in page useEffect would call /api/v1/users/auth/me immediately after form submission, racing with cookie-setting process and causing 401 errors
- **Simplified Authentication**: Updated sign-in page to use dedicated /auth/login route directly instead of Server Actions with callback flow
- **Improved UX**: Added proper loading states and disabled submit button during authentication

### Technical Details
- Removed Server Action (signInActionSafe) usage in favor of direct form submission to /auth/login
- Added isSubmitting state to prevent race condition in useEffect auth check
- Updated form handling to use dedicated /auth/login route that immediately sets cookie and redirects
- Eliminated unnecessary /auth/callback route complexity that was causing timing issues

### Impact
- Users can now successfully sign in without being redirected back to sign-in page
- Authentication flow is more reliable and faster
- Simplified codebase by removing unnecessary Server Action complexity
